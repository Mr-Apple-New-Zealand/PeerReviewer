# AI Patch + Peer Review Summary

- **Patcher model:** `Qwen3-32B-imatrix:Q4_K_M`
- **Reviewer model:** `Gemma-4-31B-it-imatrix:Q4_K_M`
- **Scorer model:** `Qwen3-Coder-30B-imatrix:Q3_K_M`
- **Files the patcher rewrote:** 11
- **Rejected paths** (outside source root or invalid): 0

## Score comparison

| Stage | Found | Partial | Missed | Total | % Found |
|-------|-------|---------|--------|-------|---------|
| Baseline (before patch) | 46 | 17 | 7 | 70 | 65.7% |
| Post-patch | 1 | 13 | 56 | 70 | 1.4% |

> **How to read this table.** `%Found` is the peer reviewer's *recall*, not the patcher's success. A patch that removes bugs makes them undetectable, so those IDs move into `Missed` — that's the column to watch. `Found` and `Partial` can even shift *upwards* post-patch when the reviewer gets a cleaner view of the bugs that weren't fixed.

## Verdict

- **Issues resolved: 58** (82.9% of all seeded bugs). Bugs the reviewer named before the patch and cannot name after. Rows the scorer credited without support in the review are excluded from both sides — unverifiable `Found` ratings and `Partial` ratings alike.
- Reviewer still detects **3** of the 70 seeded issues, down from **61** before the patch.
- Taking the scorer's columns at face value would give **49**. 2 baseline and 11 post-patch rows were credited with evidence the review does not contain, and are excluded. Baseline fabrications matter most: they invent bugs the reviewer never detected, each of which then counts as resolved.

## Build check

**The patched tree does not compile — 3 new error(s).** The pristine tree compiles cleanly.

Read every figure above in this light. A resolved-issues count measures whether the reviewer can still name each bug, and code that does not build can score well on that while being unusable.

| Error | File | Line | Message |
|---|---|---|---|
| `CS0246` | `TransactionService.cs` | 125 | The type or namespace name 'SqlConnection' could not be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?) |
| `CS0246` | `TransactionService.cs` | 125 | The type or namespace name 'SqlTransaction' could not be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?) |
| `CS0246` | `UserController.cs` | 39 | The type or namespace name 'UpdateUserRequest' could not be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?) |

## Run Configuration

Values as actually used, so this run can be re-dispatched exactly. Blank sampler entries mean the request omitted them and the model's own Modelfile applied.

## Mechanical patch verification

Direct inspection of the patched source for 41 of the 69 seeded issues — those with an unambiguous textual marker. Independent of the peer reviewer, so it is not affected by review recall or scorer mis-attribution.

**36 fixed / 5 still present** (of 41 checked).

| ID | File | Still present |
|---|---|---|
| A6 | `Data/DatabaseHelper.cs` | connection-leaking GetOpenConnection still present |
| E7 | `(tree)` | no rate limiting or lockout anywhere on the login path |
| RL2 | `Data/DatabaseHelper.cs` | connection-leaking helper still exported |
| R3 | `Services/AuthService.cs` | GenerateJwtToken still over 12 lines — not split into helpers |
| CF9 | `appsettings.Production.json` | no environment-specific config file |

A marker proves the bug's *shape* is gone, not that the replacement is correct — read this next to the peer review, not instead of it.
